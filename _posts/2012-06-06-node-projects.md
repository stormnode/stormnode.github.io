I live in Corvallis, Oregon and am looking for work programming in
Javascript.  Examples of this would include Node, D3,  Backbone,  Bootstrap etc...

My areas of expertise include the NoSQL persistence engine Redis.  
I use Redis in all of my projects on the back end as my data structure server.

I am currently a big fan of Backbone and have written a tutorial on the subject based
on the Marionette framework which sits on top of Backbone and makes it easier to build
out large scale web applications.

In the CSS world I prefer  Bootstrap and so do lots of other developers as witnessed
by its rising popularity on Github.

My passion is crawling the web for information and building data sets that can be
searched, organized and visualized in a meaningful way.

I am working on a set of open source products that demonstrate this functionality and
make it easier for others to do the same.

You can check out my open source project in this area called Jobs.
