Over the past year I have spent time researching a number of areas related to large open source
projects that need sophisticated build systems.
<p>
By far the largest project that I have studied in depth is the Chrome source tree and how Google
was in the process of migrating their source project from gyp to gn.
<p>
I spent quite a bit of time understanding the inner workings of Redis especially in the area of
Hashmaps.
<p>
This is related to storing and quickly finding DNA sequences from sequencers that need to store
millions of small DNA base pairs and then quickly parse them back together by looking for
overlapping DNA patterns that need to be fit back together.
<p>
Another research interest of mine is the LLVM compiler project. One language in particular
called Terra is interesting as it uses Lua as its base language upon which it can build off of.
<p>
Areas of interest include cryptography related to the bitcoin block chain and bloom filters
for quickly finding data embedded in hash maps.
